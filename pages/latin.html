    <h2>latin as a notetaking language_</h2>
    <p>Over the summer I spent a couple weeks learning some Latin for fun. After a little while I had gotten to a place where I felt I could test my basic declension and conjugation skills by attempting to take notes on a textbook I had to read during the fall semester. Vocabulary I had yet to dive much into so I had bought an Oxford pocket English -> Latin dictionary to keep me company, and of course I kept a Google page open, but the thing that interested me the most going into it was the question of just how much shorter my notes would end up being compared to my English notes on the same topic. For those unfamiliar, Latin is a highly inflected language -- It forms its grammar from a system of different series of case endings for almost all parts of speech. For example, nouns are 'declined' for grammatical case, number and gender, and verbs are 'conjugated' for person, number, gender, tense, mood, aspect and voice. This means that, compared to English, Latin has a relatively loose syntax, but is able to be equally concise in a fewer number of words thanks to its larger number of case endings. Take this example from English:</p>
    <blockquote>The boy saw the girl</blockquote>
    <p>There are two things about this sentence that immediately stand out as unsatisfactory: The definite article 'the' is used twice, and its word order is fixed -- if you got rid of the articles you'd be left with something abstract sounding, and changing the word order randomly in almost any way will get you nonsense. But compare these equivalents from Latin:</p>
    <blockquote>Puer puellam vīdit<br><br>
        Puer vīdit puellam<br><br>
        Vīdit puellam puer</blockquote>
    <p>While Latin is typically constructed in a [Subject -> Object -> Verb] (or SOV) form, its sentence parts can be arranged in any way, as all of the necessary grammatical information is supplied by the words' case endings. All of the above mean 'The boy saw the girl', as puer means 'boy' in the nominative, or subject case, puellam is an inflection of 'puella', or 'girl', in the accusative, or object case, and vīdit means 'saw', as it is 'video', or 'I see', in the 3rd person singular perfect indicative.</p>
    <p>This means that if we wanted to, for purposes of emphasis or perhaps even mnemonics, we could rearrange words away from the typical SOV form, or create a perfectly legal 'anastrophe', on the basis of constructing a sentence around a descending order of importance for the words in that sentence. A special form of this, called hyperbaton, allows for both emphatic and parenthetical sentence construction. The ability especially to be able to easily embed emphasis into text of rough penmanship rids the note-taker of the need to substitute for otherwise illegible italics.</p>
    <p>The one problem we run into is that of vocabulary. While Latin's continued scholarly use long after its death as a living language has preserved the relevance of its pool of vocabulary, especially through its formal adoption in studia such as Biology and Law, its status as a learned and not lived language has simultaneously stifled its evolution relative to the world around it. If you want to talk about emoji, mufflers, or memes, you're going to have to rely on some pretty fudged neologisms. A large but far from exhaustive list compiled by the Vatican represents the kind of trickery you need to get Latin to say what you want in today's day and age [link at the bottom of the page]. Scrolling through it you'll quickly realize that many of those relatively common nouns become phrases in Latin, because there simply weren't arbitrarily developed words from back in Roman times to describe objects that wouldn't have existed then. For example, the sprawling radioëléctricum instrumentum detectórium is the Vatican's best attempt at 'radar'. If the Romans had that kind of technology, maybe they'd have named it something like 'deovīsōrum', but they didn't.</p>
    <p>I'd love to read a paper on this sort of thing: can some (for the sake of simplicity, alphabetic) languages save paper and add a degree of notetaking flexibility, while being as equally expressive in technical contexts as English? In becoming familiar with Latin I genuinely think it can, or at least where huge amounts of technical jargon aren't concerned, you really can make your way through a lecture with half the paper and yet end up with more precision than otherwise. English really doesn't suit itself well to the quick, pithy statements written down in a notebook so much as it does to sprawling yet beautiful prose.</p>
